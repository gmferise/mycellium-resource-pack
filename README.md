# Installation Guide
If you've never used GitHub for resource packs before, it's pretty simple.
Click the green Clone or Download button and select .ZIP File.
Once it's downloaded, open the .ZIP file and move the folder inside to your resource packs folder. If you paste `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks` into the path bar in the file explorer, it will take you there.
