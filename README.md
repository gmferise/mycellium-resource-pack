# Installation Guide
If you've never used GitHub for resource packs before, it's pretty simple.
- Go to [the releases page](https://github.com/gmferise/mycellium-resource-pack/releases) and choose a release version to download. Make sure you download the file under the release with a name like `Mycellium-v1.2-VersionName.zip`, not one of the Source versions.
- Locate your resource packs folder by clicking "Open Pack Folder" in the Resourcepacks menu of Minecraft, or by pasting `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks` into the path bar of file explorer.
- Move the downloaded zip file into the resource packs folder
- Equip the pack in-game. (You may need to restart your client or press F3+T before the pack shows in the menu).
